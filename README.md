# Chess E-Commerce Website 🧠♟️

This is an academic project I built in 2023 — my first fully functional website using **PHP**, **MySQL**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The site is designed to serve as an **e-commerce platform for chess-related products** such as boards, pieces, books and accessories.

- 📦 **Features Include:**
  - Product listing and search
  - Shopping cart system
  - Basic user authentication
  - Checkout simulation
